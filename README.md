# EpokaLibrarySystem
This repository contains the Web Application for the Epoka University Library. This WebApp serves as an online library, in order to help all Epoka students gain easier and immediate access to all the books offered by the university. 

### How does it work? 
The system saves the information about each book to the database, and using PHP and JavaScript as well as Ajax requests and JSON, the information is made available to the students, who are one of the users which are implemented at the moment. 

### Features offered to students.
Students can view the available books, place orders, save books to favorites, as well as send feedback to the administrator. Later on, a comment section will be implemented, in which all students can add their comments about the books. To allow easier access to the library items, students can filter the results, search for the books they need and browse them by their categories. 

### Disclaimer: 
The project is still under construction. Expect new features to be added along the development process.
